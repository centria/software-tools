## Part 1

The first actual part of this course is actually another, smaller course: [**course for command line and version control**](https://centria.github.io/console/). This gives you tools to learn how to create your own Git repository and how to use it.

If you have not done it yet, go and do it **now**.

This is individual work, but you can of course help each other.
