## Part 2

To begin our journey for software development tools (beyond Git and console), we have to understand a little bit on the different methologies of software development. For that, read up on

* Scrum
* Kanban
* XP (extreme programming)
* Agile
* Waterfall

[**Good starting point is for example here**](https://www.smartsheet.com/agile-vs-scrum-vs-waterfall-vs-kanban). 

[**Another one can be found here**](https://dzone.com/articles/agile-framework-comparison-scrum-vs-kanban-vs-lean).

Do notice, that these are companies selling points for their own products, but they cover the different views quite nicely.

There are other sources in the internet, as well. Do search information from your favorite search engine.

**Write an essay of 2 to 3 pages on the subject** (so about half a page on each of the topics mentioned above), preferably comparing the differences between the methologies. 

Send your essay via email. The essay should preferably be as a PDF, but a link to Google Docs, Microsoft docx and txt are also fine.


The idea is to get some understanding, what are the differences between different methologies and framewworks, before we start using them in real life.
