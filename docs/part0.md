## Slack

Create a [**Slack instance**](https://slack.com) for the whole course. Make the name something meaningful. 

For the course of 2020, this has already been created by the teacher.

* One person creates the Slack instance.
* Invite all your coursemates to the Slack.
* Invite your teacher to the Slack.
* Create a channel for each small group in the course.
* Invite the group members and the teacher to those channels.
* Check that there are only your group members in the channel.
* You can make the group channel private, if you want. If Slack says "no", ask the admin (creator of the Slack) to do it.
