# How to create a page

Create a new repository and use this as a template. 

Name your repository with the course name you want in the address. The address will be in format `https://centria.github.io/<repository>/`.  
Use only letters, numbers and dashes in the repository name!

In your new repository, go to SETTINGS. Scroll down to GitHub Pages and select `master branch` as your source. If you want to use another branch, select that instead. DO NOT CHOOSE A THEME. This template uses a remote theme and is already set up.

Your page should be ready and online. This might take a few minutes.
