## Kanban

* Read more about [**Kanban. The link goes to Wikipedia.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)
* Create a [**Trello board**](https://trello.com/) with your small group. You will have to register to the service. Give the board the name of your small group, if possible.
* Make the board public, and send the link of your board to your group channel.
* Consider the following small programming task, and create a simple **KANBAN BOARD** in Trello for developing it.

The customer wants a program, which has an classes for different animals. The Program should have a Main class as well. The pets should have a method **public void TalkToOwner()**. All the classes and methods need to be tested. For the first version, there has to be at least classes **Cat**, **Dog** and **Bird**.

* In your board, you should have at least these lists:
  * To do / Product backlog
  * Working / In progress
  * Waiting / Blocked
  * Done
* Start your board as if we were only just planning the product, so that all the cards are in the **"To do"** list.
* Cards should be made out of small parts of code, such as **"Create Main method"** or **"Create Pet class"**
* You can have more, if you feel like this is not enough
* **YOU DO NOT HAVE TO IMPLEMENT ANY CODE**! This is a planning exercise.
* You can ask for help in the *#general* channel in Slack.
* You do not have to have all perfect. The idea is to learn how such a tool works.
* We will go through your boards in a remote session, and you will get feedback.

* Deadline 31.3.2020 at 23:59:59 (board up, link in the group chat, some cards done)
